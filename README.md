# barcode-server

A simple daemon to read barcodes from USB Barcode Scanners
and expose them to other service using a websocket API.

# How to use

## Device Access Permissions

Ensure the user running this application is in the correct group for accessing
input devices (usually `input`), like this:
```
sudo usermod -a -G input myusername
```

## Docker

When starting the docker container, make sure to pass through input devices:
```
docker run
  --name barcode \
  --device=/dev/input \
  markusressel/barcode-server
```

# API

By default the service will expose a websocket on `127.0.0.1` on port `9654`.
When specified in the config, an API token is required to authorize clients, which must be passed using a `X-Auth-Token` header when connecting.
Since barcode-scanner is stateless, the token is specified in the configuration file.

Messages received on this websocket are JSON formatted strings with the following format:
```json
{
  "device": {
    "name": "BARCODE SCANNER BARCODE SCANNER",
    "path": "/dev/input/event3",
    "vendorId": "ffff",
    "productId": "0035",
  },
  "barcode": "4250168519463"
}
```

To test things out you can use f.ex. `websocat`:

```
> websocat ws://127.0.0.1:9654 --header "X-Auth-Token:EmUSqjXGfnQwn5wn6CpzJRZgoazMTRbMNgH7CXwkQG7Ph7stex"
{"device":{"name":"BARCODE SCANNER BARCODE SCANNER","path":"/dev/input/event3","vendorId":65535,"productId":53},"barcode":"D-t38409355843o52230Lm54784"}
{"device":{"name":"BARCODE SCANNER BARCODE SCANNER","path":"/dev/input/event3","vendorId":65535,"productId":53},"barcode":"4250168519463"}
```

# HTTP Post

When configured, you can let **barcode-scanner** issue a `POST` request when a barcode is scanned.
The body of the request will contain the same JSON as in the websocket API example.

To do this simply add the following section to your config:
```yaml
barcode_server:
  [...]
  http:
    url: "https://my.domain.com/barcode"
```

Have a look at the [example config](barcode_server.yaml) for more options.

# FAQ

## Can I lock the Barcode Scanner to this application?

Most barcode readers normally work like a keyboard, resulting in their input being evaluated by
the system, which can clutter up your TTY or other open programs.
**barcode-server** will try to _grab_ input devices, making it the sole recipient of all
incoming input events from those devices, which should prevent the device from cluttering
your TTY.

If, for some reason, this does not work for you, try this:

Create a file `/etc/udev/rules.d/10-barcode.rules`:
```
SUBSYSTEM=="input", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="xxxx", ATTRS{idProduct}=="yyyy", RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo remove > /sys$env{DEVPATH}/uevent'"
SUBSYSTEM=="input", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="xxxx", ATTRS{idProduct}=="yyyy", DEVPATH=="*:1.0/*", KERNEL=="event*", RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'ln -sf /dev/input/$kernel /dev/input/barcode_scanner'"
```
Replace the `idVendor` and `idProduct` values with the values of your barcode reader (a 4 digit hex value with leading zeros).
You can find them in the log output of **barcode-reader** or using `lsusb` with the wireless receiver attached to your computer.

Reload udev rules using:
```
udevadm control --reload
```
then remove and reinsert the wireless receiver.
You should now have a symlink in `/dev/input/barcode_scanner`:
```
ls -lha /dev/input/barcode_scanner
```
which can be used in the `device_paths` section of the **barcode-server** config.
